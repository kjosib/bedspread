Bed Spread: an Expression-Oriented Code-in-Database System
==========================================================

*Bed Spread* aims to re-imagine and reshape the act of programming in a high-level computer language
as a richly semantic interaction with a deeply structured and assistive database of functionality.
Also, it's still pre-alpha. Current goal is a text-console-hosted evaluator spike by June,
then a graphical shell by July.

.. warning:: **Bed Spread** is still being invented. Documentation may therefore get out ahead of reality.
