Console Input and Output
=========================

The first plan is to connect Python's ``print`` and ``input`` functions once the evaluator has string support.
Later on, it might be interesting to experiment with adding console-specific APIs, but honestly these days
who uses a text console for new projects?

Oh yes. I just did.
