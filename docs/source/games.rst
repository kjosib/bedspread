Retro Text Games
------------------

Getting your Feet Wet
......................

The first game to build is a simple version of Conway's Game of Life.
It will need to wait for console I/O, a delay function, and probably arrays or another suitable data structure.

The other obvious candidate is *animals*, which is actually about binary trees.
It's fun for small children. To make it last longer than one play session requires durable storage,
such as to a file or database.

Having More Fun
................

Many games you might think of as purely graphical originally had text-only versions.
For example, the first combat simulators were turn-based text-based affairs:
Perhaps you'd type an angle and a power level to aim a notional cannon at your foe,
accounting for wind speed and direction, and then see the result plotted as a hit or a miss.

Variations on this theme include:

* tanks on mountainous terrain (e.g. ``gorillas.bas``),
* orbital combat (which is much harder), and
* ships at sea

Graphical Games
-------------------

This is going to have to wait -- probably for plugging in PyGame.
