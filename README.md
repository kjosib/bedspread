# Bed Spread: an Expression-Oriented Code-in-Database System

## Abstract

This project represents an attempt to do for general-purpose programming
what Visicalc did for most common forms of data modelling and analysis.
Drawing inspiration from many corners, we build a reasonable functional
programming system with principle representation in terms of a ubiquitous,
unencumbered, and semantically-empowered storage format: the SQLite
relational database (structured as records for each declaration) rather
than conventional text-files. Existing generic database editors thus
make powerful interim tooling for bootstrapping an ecosystem.

Results are in progress, and conclusions are to be determined.

## The remainder of the paper...

The rest of this paper is presently still under construction at
[this link](https://github.com/kjosib/kjosib.github.io/blob/main/Contrib/Bed%20Spread.md)
but when finished it will most likely be moved to readthedocs.io.

## Documentation:

Documentation will be hosted on readthedocs.io. A first-draft list of headings is:

* Starting with *Bed Spread*: How to open the REPL and play
* The *Bed Spread* expression grammar
* Functions you can use, right out of the box
* Make your own functions
* Simple Input and Output
* Data Structures
* I/O with Files:
  * Structured
  * Free-form
* Turtle Graphics
* Games
* Sharing your project
* Bindings to components written in other languages
* System Internals

## Application to Education

The specific STEM skill exposure to this system should most improve is functional abstraction. 

Part of the plan is to get turtle graphics into the mix fairly early on.
Also, the aim is an approachable, highly interactive, and supportive functional programming system.
Once students have a grasp of mathematical syntax, they should be able to write formulas for fun and profit.
The on-screen supportive development environment should remove most frustrations associated with large code files.
Once *Bed Spread* is in shape for it, I would welcome the help of educators to build curricula based on
subsets of the complete system and aligned either with concurrently-taught topics,
or perhaps something kids enjoy like making and playing games (e.g. 2-D side scrollers like "Flighty Avian").
