Make your own Functions
==========================

Technically at the moment it's possible to inject lambda abstractions into other lambda abstractions,
but the real vision is to have the user-defined functions all in a database. That's coming soon.

In the first phase, it will be this ugly thing where you need a separate database editor.
But that will be the motivation to produce a simple graphical program editor,
and then it's all downhill from there. Probably.
