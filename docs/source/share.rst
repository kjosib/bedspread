Sharing your Programs with Others
=================================

In concept, you should be able to just pass SQLite database files around the way we currently trade sources and patches.
In practice, some concept of a "patch" may need to develop for some kinds of collaboration.
Other, more direct collaboration might be facilitated by using a centralized database instead of SQLite.
How best to orchestrate this kind of thing in different social contexts is an open area for investigation.
